There is an all hands meeting. You need to collect the feedback of everyone who attended. 
You should first ask Huang Jie for names of all the participants.
Then, ask each of the participant for feedback and score (1-5) about the meeting.
You will need to write the feedback and scores in an excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx'
