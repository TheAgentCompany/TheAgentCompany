# Checkpoints

This task has 6 points in total. It is composed of two parts:
1. Add a new endpoint (POST) that is the same as the create_pair endpoint, but with mock LLM calls.
Check if this even runs.
2. Ensure that the endpoint actually runs successfully with the correct outputs

## Checkpoint 1 (3pt)

Check if the new endpoint even successfully invokes

## Final checkpoint (4pts)

Check if the new endpoint returns the correct test output
