Before we publicize our company's Gitlab homepage, we want to fill in the documenation page (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia) with introductions for each repo we have. 
You need to edit the README.md file in Documentation, and put in information for all other repositories that are under the Administrator author.
For each repo, include their name with a link to the repo, and put in a one-sentence description for it.
On the bottom of the README, put in a contact section with Mike Chen's information. You can reach him at mikechen@example.com.
