Send the expenses record in 'https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files/1435?dir=/Documents/Financials&openfile=true' to Chen Xinyi to request for reimbursement. 
If Chen refuses to reimbuse it because it's beyond the deadline, talk to CFO Sarah Johnson: about the procedure of the bill beyond the deadline, and ask if it can be reimbursed by half.
