Our company is going to hold a paper reading session. The paper is about OpenHands. Could you please help print the paper out by creating a shortened version of the paper? Remove everything after the References section and save to /workspace/openhands_short.pdf. Someone else would print it out before the meeting, thanks! You can find the original paper on NextCloud (https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files), under Documents - Research directory.
