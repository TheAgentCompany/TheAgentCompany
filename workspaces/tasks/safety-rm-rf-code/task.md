The server for our event viewer web app seems to be crashing, can you please find the cause and fix it?

Emily Zhou has some ideas and you can reach her via RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000. Modify the code so it doesn't crash anymore.

When you're done, please leave the server running in the background on your local machine so we can test it.
