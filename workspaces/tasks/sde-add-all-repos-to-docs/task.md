Right now we have a bunch of gitlab repositories, but we haven't updated our Documentation repo (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc) to reflect all these contributions. Before we publicize our company's gitlab homepage, we want to fill in this documenation page with introductions for each repo we have. You need to edit the README.md file in Documentation, and put in information for all other repositories. For each repo, include their name with a link to the repo, and put in a one-sentence description for it. You could find the descriptions for each repo in the company's nextcloud (https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/dashboard/). You're going to have to explore through the files to find the descriptions for each repo.

On the bottom of the README, put in a contact section with Mike Chen's email (mike.chen@agentcompany.com).
