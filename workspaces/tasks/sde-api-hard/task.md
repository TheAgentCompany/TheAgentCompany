You want to get the brief instruction of the issues and do some filtering, so first you need to find the related api interface in Plane (http://the-agent-company.com:8091).
To be more specific, you want to get the latest 10 issues in the issue list sorted by the due date in a specific workspace (let's say `tac`), what api should you request and what are the parameters.
Try to find the api by looking at the network request, then find out the api url as well as the required parameters (assume cursor set to 10:0:0). Write the full url (include the parameter for GET) to `/workspace/url_for_issues.txt`
