We need to order a new server. I think Emma Lewis has collected quotes from a few companies and put them on NextCloud. Ask her where you can find the quotes. Then download them to the workspace directory. You can discuss with Sarah about the requirements. Please create a csv file "valid-quotes.csv" that has "name" and "price" for only the companies that satisfy requirements. Upload the file to NextCloud under the Documents/Administrative Specialist directory and share the file link with Sarah.
