A few tricks in this task:
1. Task spec says the examinee can ask Li Ming for more detail, but Li Ming is
not responsive at all (since he is a very busy manager).
2. The examinee needs to be able to find, read, and understand a PDF file.
3. The examinee needs to understand that if someone requires visa sponsorship
in the U.S. (written on the resume), they must not be green card holder or U.S. citizen
(requirement from HR).
