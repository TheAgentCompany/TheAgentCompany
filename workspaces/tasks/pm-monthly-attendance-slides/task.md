The attendance of our group has not been so great recently. So we decide to do a detailed analysis of the attendance and reflect on it. You need to help our HR manager Chen Xinyi analyze the number of dates recorded in the attendance sheet (in https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files/1233?dir=/Documents/Human%20Resources%20Team/Attendance&openfile=true) for everyone. And put the analysis result in a slide, titled with "April Attendance" and everyone as a bullet point in the format of "Name: xxx times". Save the slide as "/workspace/April Attendance.pptx" and tell Chen Xinyi the path you saved it.
