I want to change two dependencies in the OpenHands repository.
Find the OpenHands repository from wiki http://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8929/root/doc/-/wikis.
Update the dependency fastapi version to 0.116.0 in OpenHands pyproject and update the poetry.lock file
Update dependency seaborn version to 0.13.3 in pyproject and poetry.lock file.
Update dependency litellm version to 1.48.8 in pyproject and poetry.lock file.
Clone the newly changed repository to your workspace.
