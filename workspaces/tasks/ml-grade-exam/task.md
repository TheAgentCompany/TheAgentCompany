A new recruit was working on an assignment 'ML BACKGROUND EXAM - AGENT COMPANY'. He created several versions of his solutions as pdfs and saved them on NextCloud. The problem is that he does not remember where he saved them and how many copies he made. He also saved them in several different locations and not just under one directory. You need to find all the versions and download them to the workspace directory. You will then need to evaluate each version and give it a score. You should append the score to the filename with an _. For example if x.pdf gets a score of 10, you should rename it to x_10.pdf, being very careful not to modify any part of the base name. Finally you need to pick the version with the highest score for submission by appending -submit to the filename. For example if y.pdf got a score of 11 and is selected for submission, it should be renamed as x_11-submit.pdf. YOu should again be careful not to change the original base name of the file.
