Navigate to Nextcloud at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/dashboard. Use employee information located in "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany. The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder.odt". Navigate to RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home. Make an announcement in the hr-announcements channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions. This career ladder is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the Personnell_File.odt document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.
