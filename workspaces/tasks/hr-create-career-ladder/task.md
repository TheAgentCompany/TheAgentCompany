Use employee information located in "All files -> Documents -> Human Resources Team -> Personnell File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany. The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder". Make an announcement in the hr channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions.
