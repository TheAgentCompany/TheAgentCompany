Now people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
The gender within the docker group should be balanced as well as the nurse group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab first
