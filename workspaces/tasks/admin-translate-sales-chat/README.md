This task requires the examinee to extract texts from an image and understand
the contents (in Chinese). The content was intentionally made casual and
obscure (yet realistic), with back-and-forth bargaining and arguing. Finally,
this task involves some mathematical computation and some tricks on units.

Here's the reference answer:

Base rate: 115 RMB per square meter per month
Area: 90 square meters
Monthly rent calculation:
115 RMB × 90 sq m = 10,350 RMB per month
For a full year lease:

First month: 10,350 RMB × 0.7 (30% discount) = 7,245 RMB
Remaining 11 months: 10,350 RMB × 11 = 113,850 RMB

Total annual cost: 7,245 + 113,850 = 121,095 RMB
Since we're interested in a full year lease, we won't need to pay the additional 2,000 RMB service fee that applies to short-term rentals.
