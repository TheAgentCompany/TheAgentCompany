You are an admin looking for a office for our company's new branch in China. Mandy
helped with some initial search, but she just left our company. A screenshot
of her chat history with a local sales is available on https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/.
You can find an image named "wechat_history.jpg" under Documents/Admin directory.

Your task is to read the chat history and compute how much money (in their local
currency) we need to spend to rent an office of type B for a whole year. Please
write down the answer in /workspace/ans.txt. Don't convert the amount to USD.
Please round the number to the nearest integer.
