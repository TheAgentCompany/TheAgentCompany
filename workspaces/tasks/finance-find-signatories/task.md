Navigate to the Rocketchat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home and ask the director of Finance for the folder path for the annual company updates. You can navigate to the path provided through NextCloud, using this link https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/.
Once you have navigated to NextCloud and obtained the annual company updates, find the Amazon 2023 report file and the Alphabet 2022 report file. Your job is to create a CSV table of all the signatories within these reports. 
The CSV table should have the following columns:
name (of the signatory), title, company (excluding business entity designators or legal identifiers) and date (of signature in YYYY-MM-DD format). Save this file as 'signatories.csv' in the '/workspace' folder.

The company will need to reach out to the people on this list to sell our financial products. Reach out to the director of sales providing this table. Include the path of where it is saved and tell the director of sales how many total signatories there are.
