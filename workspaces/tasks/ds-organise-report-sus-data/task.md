We have a lot of spreadsheet data files under the "Data Analysis" folder at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files?dir=/Documents. However, their namings are not consistent, and particularly some names are confusing or not interpretable. Go through the "Data Analysis" folder and find files that have the following issues, in a format "Issue: file name 1, file name 2, ...":

Files without meaningful names: such as a random list of characters, should be avoided
Files with all numerical names: such as "3030.xlsx" should be avoided
Files with unusual characters: such as '`', '~' etc should be avoided
Then, report the list of problematic files (that have the above issues), in a format "Issue : file name 1, file name 2, ..." in chat to Jessica Lee on http://the-agent-company.com:3000
