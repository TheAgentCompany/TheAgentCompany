Given "/workspace/stock_train_raw.csv", build a machine learning pipeline in scikit-learn to predict the daily 
closing price of stock. Save your model's predictions to the test data "/workspace/stock_test.csv" as 
"/workspace/stock_pred.csv" with one column named "Close Price". You will be evaluated on Mean Squared Error 
(MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score, with a focus on maximizing the R² score.
