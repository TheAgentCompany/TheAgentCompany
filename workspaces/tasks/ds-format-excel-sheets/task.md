Find the `respondent_counts.xlsx` at `https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu` under the `Documents/Data Analysis` folder, and based on the source "unformatted" sheet, create a "formatted" sheet called `respondent_counts_formatted.xlsx` and make formatting edits based on the following requirements:
1. Change the background color of top-header cells to skyblue (#87CEEB)
2. Make sure all cell values are horizontally centered in their cells

Do not change the "unformatted" sheet, only make changes in the "formatted" sheet.
Save all your changes to `respondent_counts_formatted.xlsx` under the `Documents/Data Analysis` folder.
