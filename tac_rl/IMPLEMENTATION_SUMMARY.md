# TAC-RL Implementation Summary

## üéØ **What We Fixed**

### **Original Problem**
The first implementation was **fundamentally broken**:
- OpenHands used external APIs (GPT-4) for task execution
- Training happened on a separate model that never saw the tasks
- **No actual performance improvement** because the executing agent wasn't being trained
- OpenPipe integration was mostly mocked

### **Corrected Architecture**
Now we have a **unified system** where:
- **Same local model** (Qwen 2.5 7B) does task execution AND gets trained
- **Real OpenPipe ART** integration with GRPO + LoRA
- **Actual weight updates** based on task outcomes
- **Progressive improvement** as the model learns from experience

## üèóÔ∏è **Complete Implementation**

### **Core Components**

1. **`local_art_trainer.py`** - Real OpenPipe ART integration
   - Uses actual `art.TrainableModel` with LoRA
   - Implements GRPO training with RULER rewards
   - Handles model checkpoints and weight updates

2. **`local_openhands_runner.py`** - Unified model execution
   - Uses the SAME model that's being trained
   - Executes tasks through OpenHands framework
   - Captures trajectories for training

3. **`architecture.py`** - Corrected training loop
   - Async execution for proper integration
   - Single model for both execution and training
   - Real performance improvement tracking

4. **`train.py`** - Updated orchestration
   - Handles async training iterations
   - GPU memory management
   - Proper error handling

### **Configuration & Setup**

5. **`configs/qwen_2_5_7b_local.yaml`** - Local training config
   - GPU-optimized settings
   - LoRA configuration
   - Memory-efficient batch sizes

6. **`setup.sh`** - Updated dependencies
   - PyTorch + CUDA
   - OpenPipe ART
   - PEFT for LoRA
   - vLLM for inference

7. **`validate_gpu.py`** - GPU validation
   - CUDA availability checks
   - Memory requirement validation
   - Dependency verification

### **Documentation**

8. **`README_CORRECTED.md`** - Fixed implementation guide
9. **`GETTING_STARTED.md`** - Updated with GPU requirements
10. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This document

## üîÑ **How It Actually Works Now**

### **Training Flow**
```python
# 1. Initialize local model with LoRA
model = TrainableModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct", peft_config)

# 2. Training iteration
for iteration in range(training_steps):
    # Sample tasks from TheAgentCompany
    tasks = sample_professional_tasks()
    
    # Execute tasks using current model weights
    results = []
    for task in tasks:
        result = await model.execute_task(task)  # Same model!
        results.append(result)
    
    # Compute rewards from task outcomes
    rewards = [compute_reward(r) for r in results]
    
    # Update model weights with GRPO
    await model.train(trajectory_groups, rewards)  # Real training!
    
    # Model is now better at professional tasks
```

### **Key Improvements**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Execution** | External API (GPT-4) | Local trained model |
| **Training** | Mocked | Real GRPO + LoRA |
| **Integration** | Disconnected | Unified architecture |
| **Improvement** | None | Progressive learning |
| **Cost** | API fees | GPU compute only |
| **Control** | Limited | Full model control |

## üìä **Expected Performance**

### **Training Progression**
